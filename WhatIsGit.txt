Wha is git?
Ans:Git is a version control 
system used by developers to track changes in source code over time.
Version Control: Keeps a history of every change made to the codebase, so you can revert to previous versions if needed.
Distributed System: Every developer has a full copy of the project history, not just the current version.
Branching & Merging: You can create branches to work on features or fixes separately from the main codebase, then merge them back in when ready.
Popular Platforms: Git is the core tool behind platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

What is version control and how can you document changes?
Ans:Version control — also known as source control or revision control — is software used to track revisions, solve integration conflicts in code, and manage different artifacts involved in software projects (e.g. design, data, images). Version control also enables frictionless communication, change, and reproducibility between developers and other team members.

With version control, you're able to track and merge branches, audit changes, and enable concurrent work to accelerate software delivery. Version control is the foundation and the stepping stone of DevOps, software architecture, and release patterns, without which an org cannot start. Using version control results in remarkable team productivity and software quality improvements.
